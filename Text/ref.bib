The concept of numerical integration is introduced and the Gauss–Lobatto–Legendre approach is presented as a way to obtain a diagonal mass matrix. The calculation of the mass and stiffness matrices is presented first at an elemental level. The synthesis of the global system of equations is discussed with the result that the diagonal mass matrix allows for a fully explicit time-extrapolation scheme. The method is presented with examples of wave propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous media.},

Following a summary of notational conventions, we introduce the elastic wave equation in its different formulations (Sect. 2.2). The acoustic wave equation is treated as a special case in Sect. 2.3. While numerical methods differ in the details of the spatio-temporal discretisation, they can still be treated within a unifying framework. The approximation of the spatial derivatives generally leads to a system of ordinary differential equations in time that is commonly referred to as the semi-discrete form of the wave equation. The semi-discrete form can be written in terms of mass and stiffness matrices (Sect. 2.4). Depending on the specifics of an application, the remaining time derivatives can then be approximated using either the Fourier transform or time-stepping algorithms such as the Newmark or leapfrog methods (Sect. 2.5).},

	abstract = {This article documents a comparative exercise for numerical simulation of ground motion, addressing the seismic response of the Grenoble site, a typical Alpine valley with complex 3D geometry and large velocity contrasts. Predictions up to 2 Hz were asked for four different structure wave-field configurations (point source and extended source, with and without surface topography). This effort is part of a larger exercise organized for the third international symposium on the effects of surface geology (ESG 2006), the complete results of which are reported elsewhere (Tsuno et al., 2009). While initial, blind computations significantly differed from one another, a remarkable fit was obtained after correcting for some nonmethodological errors for four 3D methods: the arbitrary high-order derivative discontinuous Galerkin method (ADER-DGM), the velocity-stress finite-difference scheme on an arbitrary discontinuous staggered grid (FDM), and two implementations of the spectral-element method (SEM1 and SEM2). Their basic formulation is briefly recalled, and their implementation for the Grenoble Valley and the corresponding requirements in terms of computer resources are detailed. Besides a visual inspection of PGV maps, more refined, quantitative comparisons based on time-frequency analysis greatly help in understanding the origin of differences, with a special emphasis on phase misfit. The match is found excellent below 1 Hz, and gradually deteriorates for increasing frequency, reflecting differences in meshing strategy, numerical dispersion, and implementation of damping properties. While the numerical prediction of ground motion cannot yet be considered a mature, push-button approach, the good agreement reached by four participants indicates that, when used properly, numerical simulation is actually able to handle correctly wave radiation from extended sources in complex 3D media. The main recommendation to obtain reliable numerical predictions of earthquake ground motion is to use at least two different but comparably accurate methods, for instance the present formulations and implementations of the FDM, SEM, and ADER-DGM.},

The hyperbolic piece of the governing equations is then treated with an explicit collocation scheme, while the pressure and viscous contributions are treated implicitly with a projection operator derived from a variational principle. The implementation of the technique is demonstrated on a one-dimensional inflow-outflow advection-diffusion equation, and the method is then applied to laminar two-dimensional (separated) flow in a channel expansion.

	abstract = {We present an introduction to the spectral element method, which provides an innovative numerical approach to the calculation of synthetic seismograms in 3-D earth models. The method combines the £exibility of a ¢nite element method with the accuracy of a spectral method. One uses a weak formulation of the equations of motion, which are solved on a mesh of hexahedral elements that is adapted to the free surface and to the main internal discontinuities of the model. The wave¢eld on the elements is discretized using high-degree Lagrange interpolants, and integration over an element is accomplished based upon the Gauss{\textasciicircum}Lobatto{\textasciicircum}Legendre integration rule. This combination of discretization and integration results in a diagonal mass matrix, which greatly simpli¢es the algorithm. We illustrate the great potential of the method by comparing it to a discrete wavenumber/re£ectivity method for layer-cake models. Both body and surface waves are accurately represented, and the method can handle point force as well as moment tensor sources. For a model with very steep surface topography we successfully benchmark the method against an approximate boundary technique. For a homogeneous medium with strong attenuation we obtain excellent agreement with the analytical solution for a point force.},

	abstract = {Time-dependent probabilistic seismic hazard assessment requires a stochastic description of earthquake occurrences. While short-term seismicity models are well-constrained by observations, the recurrences of characteristic on-fault earthquakes are only derived from theoretical considerations, uncertain palaeo-events or proxy data. Despite the involved uncertainties and complexity, simple statistical models for a quasi-period recurrence of on-fault events are implemented in seismic hazard assessments. To test the applicability of statistical models, such as the Brownian relaxation oscillator or the stress release model, we perform a systematic comparison with deterministic simulations based on rate- and state-dependent friction, high-resolution representations of fault systems and quasi-dynamic rupture propagation. For the specific fault network of the Lower Rhine Embayment, Germany, we run both stochastic and deterministic model simulations based on the same fault geometries and stress interactions. Our results indicate that the stochastic simulators are able to reproduce the first-order characteristics of the major earthquakes on isolated faults as well as for coupled faults with moderate stress interactions. However, we find that all tested statistical models fail to reproduce the characteristics of strongly coupled faults, because multisegment rupturing resulting from a spatiotemporally correlated stress field is underestimated in the stochastic simulators. Our results suggest that stochastic models have to be extended by multirupture probability distributions to provide more reliable results.},

The simulation results show realistic features. The acceleration spectra from the simulation are nearly flat up to almost 10 Hz, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Moreover, the simulated response spectra compare favorably with spectra obtained from the empirical ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs) currently used by building engineers, which are calibrated to high- frequency recordings of earthquake ground motions.

	abstract = {This study investigates seismic wave amplification effects in the Indo-Gangetic (IG) basin for possible large earthquakes in the region using spectral-element simulations. The Indo-Gangetic basin is a large and deep sedimentary basin that covers the northern part of India, in which several mega-cities are located, including the capital city of New Delhi. The seismicity in the region due to presence of many active tectonic faults is an important matter of concern for engineers. The damage caused in a future large earthquake could affect a huge population and hinder the development of numerous large-scale industrial establishments. Due to local soil conditions and the structural complexity of the sedimentary basin, seismic wave amplification is expected. However, the absence of seismic data for large earthquakes and limited knowledge of the structure of the basin poses challenge in estimating shaking amplifications. Therefore, we model the 3D structure of the basin using Spectral Finite Element method (Specfem3D) including the topography of the Himalayan mountains, and compute synthetic seismograms for a suite of simulated rupture scenarios. First, we use two past earthquakes in the basin to calibrate our 3D model by comparing the simulated ground motions with the recorded data. Later, we consider realizations of potential future large earthquake (Mw 7.1), by generating different kinematic rupture models. We simulate earthquake scenarios for different source parameters to quantify the statistics of expected ground shaking levels. We then infer seismic wave amplification as a function of both frequency and basin depth for complex seismic sources. Our results indicate a maximum amplification of 16 in Peak Ground Velocity (PGV) and 19–35 in Spectral Accelerations (Sa) at long periods. The results presented in this study may be useful for engineers to predict ground motions for future large earthquakes in absence of any available seismicity data.},

	abstract = {The Sea of Marmara and western Turkey are characterized by intense seismicity and crustal deformation due to transition tectonics between the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) and the extensional Aegean. Seismic imaging of the crust and uppermost mantle in W-NW Turkey is crucial to obtain a better understanding of its seismotectonics and geodynamics. So far, the Sea of Marmara and surroundings were considered in various active and passive seismic experiments providing significant information on crustal properties. Here, we further investigate the 3-D seismic velocity structure in this rapidly deforming region using non-linear full-waveform tomography based on the adjoint method. Our model is constrained by complete waveforms of 62 regional earthquakes (epicentral distance{\textless}10°) with magnitudes Mw≥3.7, which occurred between 2007 and 2015. Validation tests show that our final 3-D Earth model is able to explain seismic waveforms from earthquakes not used in the inversion at periods from 8-100s to within the data uncertainties. Furthermore, quantitative resolution analyses yield 15 to 35km horizontal resolution lengths in the shallow and deep crust beneath well-covered areas of W-NW Turkey. Our full-waveform tomography results indicate the presence of strong lateral and vertical velocity variations (2.55≤VS≤4.0km/s) down to depths of ∼35km. The seismic velocity distribution is characteristic of highly deformed and distributed crustal features along major fault zones (e.g. NAFZ and its branches), historic and recent regional volcanism (e.g. Kula volcanic province), and metamorphic core complex developments (e.g. Menderes and Kazdağ massifs). Radial anisotropy is very strong (around 20\%) throughout the crust, further attesting to strong deformation and heterogeneity. Generally, our 3-D model is overall consistent with the active tectonics of western Turkey.},

Because of the increasing quality and quantity of strong-motion datasets it would be expected that the epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction (related to lack of knowledge and data) is decreasing. In this study the predicted median ground motions from over 200 GMPEs for various scenarios are plotted against date of publication to examine whether the scatter in the predictions (a measure of epistemic uncertainty) is decreasing with time. It is found that there are still considerable differences in predicted ground motions from the various GMPEs and that the variation between estimates is not reducing although the ground motion estimated by averaging median predictions is roughly constant. For western North America predictions for moderate earthquakes have show a high level of consistency since the 1980s as do, but to a lesser extent, predictions for moderate earthquakes in Europe, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. A good match is observed between the predictions from GMPEs and the median ground motions based on observations from similar scenarios. Variations in median ground motion predictions for stable continental regions and subduction zones from different GMPEs are large, even for moderate earthquakes. The large scatter in predictions of the median ground motion shows that epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction is still large and that it is vital that this is accounted for in seismic hazard assessments.},

Since the quality and quantity of strong-motion datasets is constantly increasing it would be expected that the epistemic uncertainty in ground-motion prediction (related to lack of knowledge and data) is decreasing. This article is a continuation of the study of Douglas (Bull Earthq Eng 8(6):1515–1526, 2010) for ground-motion parameters other than peak ground acceleration (PGA) and elastic response spectral acceleration (SA). The epistemic uncertainty in the prediction of peak ground velocity and displacement, Arias intensity and relative significant duration is investigated by plotting predictions from dozens of GMPEs for these parameters against date of publication for three scenarios. In agreement with the previous study, all ground-motion parameters considered show high epistemic uncertainty (often even higher than previously reported for PGA and SA), suggesting that research efforts for the development of GMPEs for these parameters should continue and that it is vital that this uncertainty is accounted for in seismic hazard assessments. The epistemic uncertainty in the prediction of relative significant duration, however, appears to be much lower than any other strong-motion parameter, which suggests that currently available GMPEs for this intensity measure are sufficiently mature.},

	abstract = {The characterization of anelastic losses due to material internal friction has become increasingly important in geophysical exploration and other seismological applications, as these losses greatly affect the amplitude and dispersion of seismic waves. Anelasticity is usually specified in terms of the material’s quality factor, ��Q{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater}. Different viscoelastic models have been used to represent ��Q{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} as a function of frequency. Most of these models are defined in terms of stresses and strains as the primary variables. Thus, in three dimensions, a separate model needs to be associated with each of the six strain components. We introduce an internal friction model that uses, instead, displacements as primary variables. For a fiber, the proposed model consists of a set of three distinct elements in parallel with different relaxation mechanisms: namely, two elements that consist of a spring and a dashpot in series (Maxwell) and a third element that consists of a spring and a dashpot in parallel (Voigt). In addition to saving memory, this formulation is particularly suitable for finite-element schemes. The model exhibits an almost constant quality factor within the frequency range of interest, with a tolerance of 5\% with respect to the target ��Q{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}Q{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} value, and provides a close approximation to the variation of the phase-velocity with frequency—as has been observed in empirical data. The extension of this model to 3D anelastic problems and its use in idealized cases, such as an infinite-space, a half-space, and a layered half-space, and the comparison of results with semi-analytical reference solutions obtained from theory and previous, similar studies, corroborates the validity of the proposed model for incorporating anelastic losses in wave propagation problems.},

The physical problem of elastic wave propagation in 1D serves as a model system with which the various numerical methods are introduced and compared. The theoretical background is presented with substantial graphical material supporting the concepts. The results can be reproduced with the supplementary electronic material provided as python codes embedded in Jupyter notebooks. The book starts with a primer on the physics of elastic wave propagation, and a chapter on the fundamentals of parallel programming, computational grids, mesh generation, and hardware models. The core of the book is the presentation of numerical solutions of the wave equation with six different methods: 1) the finite-difference method; 2) the pseudospectral method (Fourier and Chebyshev); 3) the linear finite-element method; 4) the spectral-element method; 5) the finite-volume method; and 6) the discontinuous Galerkin method. Each chapter contains comprehension questions, theoretical, and programming exercises. The book closes with a discussion of domains of application and criteria for the choice of a specific numerical method, and the presentation of current challenges.

	abstract = {In recent years, uncertainty has been widely recognized in geosciences, leading to an increased need for its quantiﬁcation. Predicting the subsurface is an especially uncertain effort, as our information either comes from spatially highly limited direct (1-D boreholes) or indirect 2-D and 3-D sources (e.g., seismic). And while uncertainty in seismic interpretation has been explored in 2-D, we currently lack both qualitative and quantitative understanding of how interpretational uncertainties of 3-D datasets are distributed. In this work, we analyze 78 seismic interpretations done by ﬁnalyear undergraduate (BSc) students of a 3-D seismic dataset from the Gullfaks ﬁeld located in the northern North Sea. The students used Petrel to interpret multiple (interlinked) faults and to pick the Base Cretaceous Unconformity and Top Ness horizon (part of the Middle Jurassic Brent Group). We have developed open-source Python tools to explore and visualize the spatial uncertainty of the students’ fault stick interpretations, the subsequent variation in fault plane orientation and the uncertainty in fault network topology. The Top Ness horizon picks were used to analyze fault offset variations across the dataset and interpretations, with implications for fault throw. We investigate how this interpretational uncertainty interlinks with seismic data quality and the possible use of seismic data quality attributes as a proxy for interpretational uncertainty. Our work provides a ﬁrst quantiﬁcation of fault and horizon uncertainties in 3-D seismic interpretation, providing valuable insights into the inﬂuence of seismic image quality on 3-D interpretation, with implications for deterministic and stochastic geomodeling and machine learning.},

	abstract = {We investigate aftershock focal mechanisms along the eastern part of the Izmit Mw = 7.4 August 17, 1999 rupture zone during the time period August 22, 1999–October 17, 1999. Two spatial clusters of aftershock activity are analyzed representing the Karadere Fault (KF) and the Düzce Area (DA). Based on an aftershock hypocenter catalogue restricted to events with horizontal and vertical errors b 2 km, we determine fault plane solutions for 221 events. The high number of focal mechanisms at the eastern Izmit rupture zone could be determined only due to the low magnitude-detection threshold of the seismic network and allows to resolve the local deformation pattern with unprecedented precision. Focal mechanisms along the Karadere Fault allow us to identify dominantly dextral strike–slip mechanisms with normal faulting components on NE–SW trending fault planes. Focal mechanisms in the Düzce Area predominantly exhibit NE–SW extensional normal faulting but also a substantial part of strike–slip faulting. Further subdivision of the data set slightly decreases for the misﬁt for deeper (z N 10 km) events. North and east of the easternmost end of the Karadere Fault we observe a high variance in stress ﬁeld orientation correlated with lower b-values. While the Karadere Fault reﬂects a predominant dextral strike–slip regime with normal faulting components, the Düzce Area further to the East that also hosted the forthcoming Mw = 7.2 mainshock 87 days after the Izmit earthquake can be subdivided into a dominantly NE–SW extensional normal faulting regime below the Düzce Basin (DB) and a ﬁrst-order strike–slip regime along the western Düzce Fault (DF). We conclude that the Düzce Basin was set under tension by the Izmit rupture and partly released the slip deﬁcit by extensional faulting on Karadere Fault parallel to the coseismic displacement. At the same time this area and in particular the Düzce Fault that bounds the Düzce Basin to the south reﬂects mostly strike–slip events representing a major asperity along the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) before initiating the Düzce rupture 87 days after the Izmit event.},

The focal mechanism solution representation based on Euler rotation was introduced, using three Euler angles in place of the plunges and azimuths of T, B, and P axes, and three focal mechanism solution representations were briefly compared and analyzed in respect of accuracy on the basis of the assumption of rounding; it was concluded that the Euler angle representation has better accuracy, compared with the azimuth representation and the traditional representation with T, B, and P axes.},

A total of 137 earthquakes (Mw {\textgreater} 3.5) are used for the Ml inversion for the whole country. Three Ml scales, whole country, East, and West Turkey, are developed, and the scales also include the station correction terms. Since the scales for the two parts of the country are very similar, it is concluded that a single Ml scale is suitable for the whole country. Available data indicate the new scale to suffer from saturation beyond magnitude 6.5. For this data set, the horizontal amplitudes are on average larger than vertical amplitudes by a factor of 1.8. The recommendation made is to measure Ml amplitudes on the vertical channels and then add the logarithm scale factor to have a measure of maximum amplitude on the horizontal. The new Ml is compared to Mw from EMSC, and there is almost a 1:1 relationship, indicating that the new scale gives reliable magnitudes for Turkey.},

	abstract = {The past devastating earthquakes in densely populated urban centers, such as the 1994 Northridge; 1995 Kobe; 1999 series of Kocaeli, Düzce, and Athens; and 2011 Van-Erciş events, showed that substantial social and economic losses can be expected. Previous studies indicate that inadequate emergency response can increase the number of casualties by a maximum factor of 10, which suggests the need for research on rapid earthquake shaking damage and loss estimation. The reduction in casualties in urban areas immediately following an earthquake can be improved if the location and severity of damages can be rapidly assessed by information from rapid response systems. In this context, a research project (TUBITAK-109M734) titled “Real-time Information of Earthquake Shaking, Damage, and Losses for Target Cities of Thessaloniki and Istanbul” was conducted during 2011–2014 to establish the rapid estimation of ground motion shaking and related earthquake damages and casualties for the target cities. In the present study, application to Istanbul metropolitan area is presented. In order to fulfill this objective, earthquake hazard and risk assessment methodology known as Earthquake Loss Estimation Routine, which was developed for the Euro-Mediterranean region within the Network of Research Infrastructures for European Seismology EC-FP6 project, was used. The current application to the Istanbul metropolitan area provides real-time ground motion information obtained by strong motion stations distributed throughout the densely populated areas of the city. According to this ground motion information, building damage estimation is computed by using grid-based building inventory, and the related loss is then estimated. Through this application, the rapidly estimated information enables public and private emergency management authorities to take action and allocate and prioritize resources to minimize the casualties in urban areas during immediate post-earthquake periods. Moreover, it is expected that during an earthquake, rapid information of ground shaking, damage, and loss estimations will provide vital information to allow appropriate emergency agencies to take immediate action, which will help to save lives. In general terms, this study can be considered as an example for application to metropolitan areas under seismic risk.},

This article presents a comprehensive validation of the commonly used Graves and Pitarka hybrid broadband ground motion simulation methodology with a recently developed three-dimensional (3D) Canterbury Velocity Model. This is done through simulation of 148 small magnitude earthquake events in the Canterbury, New Zealand, region in order to supplement prior validation efforts directed at several larger magnitude events. Recent empirical ground motion models are also considered to benchmark the simulation predictive capability, which is examined by partitioning the prediction residuals into the various components of ground motion variability. Biases identified in source, path, and site components suggest that improvements to the predictive capabilities of the simulation methodology can be made by using a longer high-frequency path duration model, reducing empirical Vs30-based low-frequency site amplification, and utilizing site-specific velocity models in the high-frequency simulations.},

Both point-source model and finite-fault model are used and the effects of soil profile are considered. The emphasis is on treatment of uncertainty and efficiency in application to evaluation of structural performance in both the linear and nonlinear range. The results show that the uniform hazard response spectra calculated from the simulated motions are comparable to those corresponding to USGS hazard maps. The suites of ten ground motions selected to match the uniform hazard response spectra represent events of different magnitudes, distances, and attenuation. The median value of the structural response to the selected ground motions matches closely the uniform hazard linear and nonlinear response spectra based on nine thousand ground motions and has a coefficient of variation of less than 10\%. The suites of uniform hazard ground motions therefore can be used in probabilistic performance evaluation with good accuracy and efficiency.},

	abstract = {A method for generating a suite of synthetic ground motion time-histories for specified earthquake and site characteristics defining a design scenario is presented. The method employs a parameterized stochastic model that is based on a modulated, filtered white-noise process. The model parameters characterize the evolving intensity, predominant frequency, and bandwidth of the acceleration time-history, and can be identified by matching the statistics of the model to the statistics of a target-recorded accelerogram. Sample ‘observations’ of the parameters are obtained by fitting the model to a subset of the NGA database for far-field strong ground motion records on firm ground. Using this sample, predictive equations are developed for the model parameters in terms of the faulting mechanism, earthquake magnitude, source-to-site distance, and the site shear-wave velocity. For any specified set of these earthquake and site characteristics, sets of the model parameters are generated, which are in turn used in the stochastic model to generate the ensemble of synthetic ground motions. The resulting synthetic acceleration as well as corresponding velocity and displacement time-histories capture the main features of real earthquake ground motions, including the intensity, duration, spectral content, and peak values. Furthermore, the statistics of their resulting elastic response spectra closely agree with both the median and the variability of response spectra of recorded ground motions, as reflected in the existing prediction equations based on the NGA database. The proposed method can be used in seismic design and analysis in conjunction with or instead of recorded ground motions. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {We present the results of a new genera tion of probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for Switzerland. This study replaces the previous intensity-based generation of national hazard maps of 1978. Based on a revised moment-magnitude earthquake catalog for Switzerland and the surrounding regions, covering the period 1300–2003, sets of recurrence parameters (a and b values, Mmax ) are estimated. Information on active faulting in Switzerland is too sparse to be used as source model. We develop instead two models of areal sources. The first oriented towards capturing historical and instrumental seismicity, the second guided largely by tectonic principles and express ing the alterative view that seismicity is less stationary and thus future activity may occur in previously quiet regions. To estimate three alterna tive a and b value sets and their relative weighting, we introduce a novel approach based on the modified Akaike information criterion, which allows us to decide when the data in a zone deserves to be fitted with a zone-specific b value. From these input parameters, we simulate synthetic earthquake catalogs of one-million-year duration down to magnitude 4.0, which also reflect the difference in depth distribution between the Alpine Foreland and the Alps. Using a specific predictive spectral ground motion model for Switzerland, we estimate expected ground motions in units of the 5\% damped acceleration response spectrum at frequencies of 0.5–10 Hz for all of Switzerland, referenced to rock sites with an estimated shear wave velocity of 1,500 m/s2 in the upper 30 m. The highest hazard is found in the Wallis, in the Basel region, in Graubünden and along the Alpine front, with maximum spectral accelerations at 5 Hz frequency reaching 150 cm/s2 for a return period of 475 years and 720 cm/s2 for 10,000 years.},

The reduced estimate of the model standard deviation may also be more representative of the true aleatory uncertainty in the ground-motion predictions. The epistemic uncertainty due to input variable uncertainty and uncertainty in the estimation of the GMPE coefficients are examined. An enhanced methodology is presented that may be used to analyse their impacts on GMPEs and GMPE predictions. The impacts of accounting for the input variable uncertainty in GMPEs are demonstrated using example values from the literature and by applying the methodology to the GMPE for Arias Intensity. This uncertainty is found to have a significant effect on the estimated coefficients of the model and a small effect on the value of the model standard deviation. The impacts of uncertainty in the GMPE coefficients are demonstrated by quantifying the uncertainty in hazard maps. This paper provides a consistent approach to quantifying the epistemic uncertainty in hazard maps using Monte Carlo simulations and a logic tree framework. The ability to quantify this component of epistemic uncertainty offers significant enhancements over methods currently used in the creation of hazard maps as it is both theoretically consistent and can be used for any magnitude–distance scenario.},

	url = {https://ir.canterbury.ac.nz/handle/10092/17218},
	abstract = {This study explicitly investigates uncertainties in physics-based ground motion simulation validation for earthquakes in the Canterbury region. The simulations utilise the Graves and Pitarka (2015) hybrid methodology, with separately quantified parametric uncertainties in the comprehensive physics and simplified physics components of the model. The study is limited to the simulation of 148 small magnitude (Mw 3.5 – 5) earthquakes, with a point source approximation for the source rupture representations, which also enables a focus on a small number of relevant uncertainties. The parametric uncertainties under consideration were selected through sensitivity analysis, and specifically include: magnitude, Brune stress parameter and high frequency rupture velocity. Twenty Monte Carlo realisations were used to sample parameter uncertainties for each of the 148 events. Residuals associated with the following intensity measures: spectral acceleration, peak ground velocity, arias intensity and significant duration, were ascertained. Using these residuals, validation was performed through assessment of systematic biases in site and source terms from mixed-effects regression. Based on the results to date, initial standard deviation recommendations for parameter uncertainties, based on the Canterbury simulations have been obtained.  
 
This work ultimately provides an initial step toward explicit incorporation of modelling uncertainty in simulated ground motion predictions for future events, which will improve the use of simulation models in seismic hazard analysis. We plan to subsequently assess uncertainties for larger magnitude events with more complex ruptures, and events across a larger geographic region, as well as uncertainties due to path attenuation, site effects, and more general model epistemic uncertainties.},

	title = {Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses in seismic risk assessments on the example of {Cologne}, {Germany}},
	abstract = {Both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties associated with different sources and components of risk (hazard, exposure, vulnerability) are present at each step of seismic risk assessments. All individual sources of uncertainty contribute to the total uncertainty, which might be very high and, within the decision-making context, may therefore lead to either very conservative and expensive decisions or the perception of considerable risk. When anatomizing the structure of the total uncertainty, it is therefore important to propagate the different individual uncertainties through the computational chain and to quantify their contribution to the total value of risk. The present study analyses different uncertainties associated with the hazard, vulnerability and loss components by the use of logic trees. The emphasis is on the analysis of epistemic uncertainties, which represent the reducible part of the total uncertainty, including a sensitivity analysis of the resulting seismic risk assessments with regard to the different uncertainty sources. This investigation, being a part of the EU FP7 project MATRIX (New Multi-Hazard and Multi-Risk Assessment Methods for Europe), is carried out for the example of, and with reference to, the conditions of the city of Cologne, Germany, which is one of the MATRIX test cases. At the same time, this particular study does not aim to revise nor to reﬁne the hazard and risk level for Cologne; it is rather to show how large are the existing uncertainties and how they can inﬂuence seismic risk estimates, especially in less wellstudied areas, if hazard and risk models adapted from other regions are used.},

Many studies do not consider uncertainties in these estimates even though they can be significant and have important implications for studies of earthquake source physics. Here, we estimate seismic source parameters in the frequency domain using empirical Green's function (EGF) methods to remove effects of the travel paths between earthquakes and their recording stations. We examine uncertainties in our estimates by quantifying the resulting distributions over all stations in the array. For coseismic stress drop estimates, we find that minimum uncertainties of similar to 30\% of the estimate can be expected. To test the robustness of our results, we explore variations of the dataset using different groupings of stations, different source regions, and different EGF earthquakes. Although these differences affect our absolute estimates of stress drop, they do not greatly influence the spread in our resulting estimates. These sensitivity tests show that station selection is not the primary contribution to the uncertainties in our parameter estimates for single stations. We conclude that establishing reliable methods of estimating uncertainties in source parameter estimates (including corner frequencies, source durations, and coseismic static stress drops) is essential, particularly when the results are used in the comparisons among different studies over a range of earthquake magnitudes and locations.},

This proxy is then used to explore the space of uncertain inputs using a large number of samples, so that reliable estimates of the model's output statistics can be calculated. Three of these techniques use polynomial chaos (PC) expansions to construct the model proxy, but they differ in their approach to determining the expansions' coefficients; the fourth technique uses Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). An integral plume model for simulating the Deepwater Horizon oil-gas blowout provides examples for illustrating the different techniques. A Monte Carlo ensemble of 50,000 model simulations is used for gauging the performance of the different proxies. The examples illustrate how regression-based techniques can outperform projection-based techniques when the model output is noisy. They also demonstrate that robust uncertainty analysis can be performed at a fraction of the cost of the Monte Carlo calculation.},

	volume = {11},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AGUFM.S11B2324J},
	abstract = {Routinely and instantaneously determined moment tensor solutions deliver 
basic information for investigating faulting nature of earthquakes and
regional tectonic structure. The accuracy of full-waveform moment tensor
inversion mostly relies on azimuthal coverage of stations, data quality
and previously known earth's structure (i.e., impulse responses or
Green's functions). However, intrinsically imperfect station
distribution, noise-contaminated waveform records and uncertain earth
structure can often result in large deviations of the retrieved source
parameters from the true ones, which prohibits the use of routinely
reported earthquake catalogs for further structural and tectonic
interferences. Duputel et al. (2012) first systematically addressed the
significance of statistical uncertainty estimation in earthquake source
inversion and exemplified that the data covariance matrix, if prescribed
properly to account for data dependence and uncertainty due to
incomplete and erroneous data and hypocenter mislocation, cannot only be
mapped onto the uncertainty estimate of resulting source parameters, but
it also aids obtaining more stable and reliable results. Over the past
decade, BATS (Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology) has steadily
devoted to building up a database of good-quality centroid moment tensor
(CMT) solutions for moderate to large magnitude earthquakes that
occurred in Taiwan area. Because of the lack of the uncertainty
quantification and reliability analysis, it remains controversial to use
the reported CMT catalog directly for further investigation of regional
tectonics, near-source strong ground motions, and seismic hazard
assessment. In this study, we develop a statistical procedure to make
quantitative and reliable estimates of uncertainty in regional
full-waveform CMT inversion. The linearized inversion scheme adapting
efficient estimation of the covariance matrices associated with
oversampled noisy waveform data and errors of biased centroid positions
is implemented and inspected for improving source parameter
determination of regional seismicity in Taiwan. Synthetic inversion
tests demonstrate the resolved moment tensors would better match the

non-double-couple components and reduce the trade-off between focal
mechanism and centroid depth if individual signal-to-noise ratios and
correlation lengths for 3-component seismograms at each station and

information for mid-sized (Mw{\textasciitilde}3.5) and offshore earthquakes in Taiwan,

ObspyDMT simpliﬁes and speeds up user interaction with data centers, in more versatile ways than existing tools. The user is shielded from the complexities of interacting with different data centers and data exchange protocols and is provided with powerful diagnostic and plotting tools to check the retrieved data and metadata. While primarily a productivity tool for research seismologists and observatories, easy-to-use syntax and plotting functionality also make obspyDMT an effective teaching aid. Written in the Python programming language, it can be used as a stand-alone command-line tool (requiring no knowledge of Python) or can be integrated as a module with other Python codes. It facilitates data archiving, preprocessing, instrument correction and quality control – routine but nontrivial tasks that can consume much user time. We describe obspyDMT’s functionality, design and technical implementation, accompanied by an overview of its use cases. As an example of a typical problem encountered in seismogram preprocessing, we show how to check for inconsistencies in response ﬁles of two example stations. We also demonstrate the fully automated request, remote computation and retrieval of synthetic seismograms from the Synthetics Engine (Syngine) web service of the Data Management Center (DMC) at the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS).},

	abstract = {Turkey is located in one of the most seismically active regions in the world and consequently has been an important contributor to several international projects related to regional scale seismic hazard assessment (SHA). Among these four major projects towards the unified assessment and mapping of seismic hazard in the European-Mediterranean region, Middle East region, and at aglobal scale. These were in chronological order:: The Global Seismic Hazard Assessment Program (GSHAP), a UN/IDNDR demonstration project, produced the first seismic hazard map for the European-Mediterranean region as part of the Global Seismic Hazard Map, based on the compilation and assemblage of hazard results obtained independently in different test areas and multinational programs (Adria, Ibero-Maghreb, Central-Northern Europe, Fennoscandia, Turkey and Greece, Caucasus, Near East, the Balkans). We (as BU-KOERI) were in charge of the external project area which provided the opportunity of interaction with other European institutions. The ESC-SESAME project (European Seismological Commission -IUGS Program Project no. 382) produced a unified model for Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Assessment for Europe and the Mediterranean. We (as KOERI) have jointly worked and furthered our cooperation with European institutions involved in the project SHARE project (Seismic Hazard Harmonization in Europe ) was a Collaborative Project in the Cooperation programme of the Seventh Framework Program of the European Commission. SHARE's main objective was to provide a community-based seismic hazard model for the Euro-Mediterranean region with update mechanisms. We (as BU\_KOERI) have jointly implemented our knowledge through a multidisciplinary work, and furthered our cooperation with European institutions involved in the project EMME project (the Earthquake Model of the Middle East) aimed to contribute and facilitate the seismic risk reduction in the Middle East region through the realization of the following specific tasks: 1) Calculate seismic hazard uniformly and with highest standards, 2) Rigorously validate earthquake and shaking probabilities using regional and global data, 3) Communicate seismic risk clearly, accurately and transparently, 4) Integrate local expertise in a regional and global context. Several institutions from Turkey have contributed to EMME and BU-KOERI has also acted as one of the project coordinators. There have been two recent national projects towards the assessment and mapping of seismic hazard for the Turkish Territory. DLH project aimed at the preparation of an earthquake resistant design code for the construction of railways, seaports and airports (DLH, 2007;Demircioglu et al.2004). Secondly, a national earthquake strategy and action plan were conceived and accordingly with the collaboration of the several institutions and expert researchers, the Revision of Turkish Seismic Hazard Map Project (UDAP-Ç -13-06) was initiated. Due to the necessity to review the national active fault database and the compiled earthquake catalogue for the development of a national earthquake hazard map, developed techniques, increased knowledge and improved databases were used for the revision of Turkish Seismic Hazard Map. SHARE (Woessner et al, 2013); EMME (Danciu et al, 2017, Sesetyan et al., 2017), and UDAP-Ç -13-06 models use multiple source modelling approaches combined in a logic tree structure. In the present study, we compare PSHA results obtained from the above-mentioned national and international studies, in terms of hazard curves for major city locations in Turkey, and the contribution of the different source models to the results.},

	abstract = {With dense seismic arrays and advanced imaging methods, regional three-dimensional (3D) Earth models have become more accurate. It is now increasingly feasible and advantageous to use a 3D Earth model to better locate earthquakes and invert their source mechanisms by fitting synthetics to observed waveforms. In this study, we develop an approach to determine both the earthquake location and source mechanism from waveform information. The observed waveforms are filtered in different frequency bands and separated into windows for the individual phases. Instead of picking the arrival times, the traveltime differences are measured by cross-correlation between synthetic waveforms based on the 3D Earth model and observed waveforms. The earthquake location is determined by minimizing the cross-correlation traveltime differences. We then fix the horizontal location of the earthquake and perform a grid search in depth to determine the source mechanism at each point by fitting the synthetic and observed waveforms. This new method is verified by a synthetic test with noise added to the synthetic waveforms and a realistic station distribution. We apply this method to a series of MW3.4–5.6 earthquakes in the Longmenshan fault (LMSF) zone, a region with rugged topography between the eastern margin of the Tibetan plateau and the western part of the Sichuan basin. The results show that our solutions result in improved waveform fits compared to the source parameters from the catalogs we used and the location can be better constrained than the amplitude-only approach. Furthermore, the source solutions with realistic topography provide a better fit to the observed waveforms than those without the topography, indicating the need to take the topography into account in regions with rugged topography.},

	abstract = {We investigate errors in centroid earthquake parameters due to unmodeled structural heterogeneity. We generate a simulated dataset consisting of synthetic seismograms for 50 earthquakes and 150 stations distributed globally. To generate the synthetic seismograms we use a spectral-element wave-propagation package (SPECFEM3D\_GLOBE) that accounts for the Earth’s three-dimensional structure. An established centroid–moment-tensor inversion algorithm from the Global CMT project is used to invert the synthetic dataset, with and without added noise, for earthquake source parameters. This algorithm uses a one-dimensional earth structure, together with approximate corrections for three-dimensional structure, to model the seismograms. We interpret the differences between the estimated source parameters and the parameters used to compute the synthetic dataset as errors due to unmodeled structural heterogeneity and the presence of noise. We expect that the errors obtained in this study are representative of the errors in the Global CMT catalogue. We find that the errors in scalar moment, moment-tensor elements and location are small on average. The depth and centroid time are, however, biased by a small amount. We find that the error in depth can be reduced significantly by applying corrections for the difference in the velocity structure at the source and receiver locations from the Earth’s average structure in the CMT inversions. This modification has a minimal effect on the errors in centroid time. We do not find large errors in scalar moments, even where the crustal thickness at the source is very different from the Earth’s average crustal thickness.},

	abstract = {It is possible to use the waveform data not only to derive the source mechanism of an earthquake but also to establish the hypocentral coordinates of the ‘best point source’ (the centroid of the stress glut density) at a given frequency. Thus two classical problems of seismology are combined into a single procedure. Given an estimate of the origin time, epicentral coordinates and depth, an initial moment tensor is derived using one of the variations of the method described in detail by Gilbert and Dziewonski (1975). This set of parameters represents the starting values for an iterative procedure in which perturbations to the elements of the moment tensor are found simultaneously with changes in the hypocentral parameters. In general, the method is stable, and convergence rapid. Although the approach is a general one, we present it here in the context of the analysis of long-period body wave data recorded by the instruments of the SRO and ASRO digital network. It appears that the upper magnitude limit of earthquakes that can be processed using this particular approach is between 7.5 and 8.0; the lower limit is, at this time, approximately 5.5, but it could be extended by broadening the passband of the analysis to include energy with periods shorter that 45 s. As there are hundreds of earthquakes each year with magnitudes exceeding 5.5, the seismic source mechanism can now be studied in detail not only for major events but also, for example, for aftershock series. We have investigated the foreshock and several aftershocks of the Sumba earthquake of August 19, 1977; the results show temporal variation of the stress regime in the fault area of the main shock. An area some 150 km to the northwest of the epicenter of the main event became seismically active 49 days later. The sense of the strike-slip mechanism of these events is consistent with the relaxation of the compressive stress in the plate north of the Java trench. Another geophysically interesting result of our analysis is that for 5 out of 11 earthquakes of intermediate and great depth the intermediate principal value of the moment tensor is significant, while for the remaining 6 it is essentially zero, which means that their mechanisms are consistent with a simple double-couple representation. There is clear distinction between these two groups of earthquakes.},

	abstract = {The centroid-moment-tensor (CMT) algorithm provides a straightforward, rapid method for the determination of seismic source parameters from waveform data. As such, it has found widespread application, and catalogues of CMT solutions – particularly the catalogue maintained by the Global CMT Project – are routinely used by geoscientists. However, there have been few attempts to quantify the uncertainties associated with any given CMT determination: whilst catalogues typically quote a ‘standard error’ for each source parameter, these are generally accepted to significantly underestimate the true scale of uncertainty, as all systematic effects are ignored. This prevents users of source parameters from properly assessing possible impacts of this uncertainty upon their own analysis. The CMT algorithm determines the best-fitting source parameters within a particular modelling framework, but any deficiencies in this framework may lead to systematic errors. As a result, the minimum-misfit source may not be equivalent to the ‘true’ source. We suggest a pragmatic solution to uncertainty assessment, based on accepting that any ‘low-misfit’ source may be a plausible model for a given event. The definition of ‘low-misfit’ should be based upon an assessment of the scale of potential systematic effects. We set out how this can be used to estimate the range of values that each parameter might take, by considering the curvature of the misfit function as minimised by the CMT algorithm. This approach is computationally efficient, with cost similar to that of performing an additional iteration during CMT inversion for each source parameter to be considered. The source inversion process is sensitive to the various choices that must be made regarding dataset, earth model and inversion strategy, and for best results, uncertainty assessment should be performed using the same choices. Unfortunately, this information is rarely available when sources are obtained from catalogues. As already indicated by Valentine and Woodhouse (2010), researchers conducting comparisons between data and synthetic waveforms must ensure that their approach to forward-modelling is consistent with the source parameters used; in practice, this suggests that they should consider performing their own source inversions. However, it is possible to obtain rough estimates of uncertainty using only forward-modelling.},

The main features of the scenario, such as its endpoints, magnitude, and gross slip distribution, were defined through expert opinion and incorporated information from many previous studies. Slip at smaller length scales, rupture speed, and rise time were constrained using empirical relationships and experience gained from previous strong-motion modeling. Using this rupture description and a 3-D model of the crust, broadband ground motions were computed over a large region of Southern California. The largest simulated peak ground acceleration (PGA) and peak ground velocity (PGV) generally range from 0.5 to 1.0 g and 100 to 250 cm/s, respectively, with the waveforms exhibiting strong directivity and basin effects. Use of a slip-predictable model results in a high static stress drop event and produces ground motions somewhat higher than median level predictions from NGA ground motion prediction equations (GMPEs).},

	abstract = {Multi-scale full waveform inversion of complete continental- and regional-scale seismograms reveals the crustal and upper-mantle signature of the North Anatolian Fault Zone which shapes the neotectonics of Turkey and the eastern Mediterranean. Within the crust, the fault zone is mostly bounded by several high-velocity blocks, suggesting that it developed along the edges of continental fragments with high rigidity. Below the crust, the surface expression of the eastern and central parts of the North Anatolian Fault Zone correlate with a pronounced low-velocity band that extends laterally over 600km. Around 100km depth, the low-velocity band merges into the shallow Anatolian asthenosphere, thereby providing a link to the Kırka–Afyon–Isparta Volcanic Field and the Central Anatolian Volcanics. We interpret the low-velocity band beneath the North Anatolian Fault Zone as the upper-mantle expression of the Tethyan sutures that formed 60–15Ma ago as a result of Africa-Eurasian convergence. The structurally weak suture facilitated the formation of the younger (less than 10Ma) crustal fault zone. In this sense, the North Anatolian Fault Zone is not only a crustal feature, but a narrow zone of weakness that extends into the upper mantle.},

	abstract = {Although both earthquake mechanism and 3-D Earth structure contribute to the seismic wavefield, the latter is usually assumed to be layered in source studies, which may limit the quality of the source estimate. To overcome this limitation, we implement a method that takes advantage of a 3-D heterogeneous Earth model, recently developed for the Australasian region. We calculate centroid moment tensors (CMTs) for earthquakes in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands. Our method is based on a library of Green's functions for each source-station pair for selected Geoscience Australia and Global Seismic Network stations in the region, and distributed on a 3-D grid covering the seismicity down to 50 km depth. For the calculation of Green's functions, we utilize a spectral-element method for the solution of the seismic wave equation. Seismic moment tensors were calculated using least squares inversion, and the 3-D location of the centroid is found by grid search. Through several synthetic tests, we confirm a trade-off between the location and the correct input moment tensor components when using a 1-D Earth model to invert synthetics produced in a 3-D heterogeneous Earth. Our CMT catalogue for PNG in comparison to the global CMT shows a meaningful increase in the double-couple percentage (up to 70\%). Another significant difference that we observe is in the mechanism of events with depth shallower then 15 km and Mw {\textless} 6, which contributes to accurate tectonic interpretation of the region.},

	abstract = {Over the last century the North Anatolian Fault Zone in Turkey has produced a remarkable sequence of large earthquakes. These events have now left an earthquake gap south of Istanbul and beneath the Marmara Sea, a gap that has not been filled for 250 years. Here we investigate the nature of the eastern end of this gap using microearthquakes recorded by seismographs primarily on the Princes Islands offshore Istanbul. This segment lies at the western terminus of the 1999 Mw7.4 Izmit earthquake. Starting from there, we identify a 30-km-long fault patch that is entirely aseismic down to a depth of 10 km. Our evidence indicates that this patch is locked and is therefore a potential nucleation point for another Marmara segment earthquake—a potential that has significant natural hazards implications for the roughly 13 million Istanbul residents immediately to its north.},

	abstract = {If a seismic event involves no external bodies, its source can be described phenomenologically by a vector field or by any one of three kinds of symmetric second-order tensor fields. The vector field is the equivalent force. The tensor fields are the stress-free strain, the stress glut, and any other moment tensor density. A particular source uniquely determines all of its descriptions except the moment tensor densities, but the motion it produces determines only the equivalent force. The source can also be described by the polynomial moments of any of its four field descriptions, and for small sources exciting long waves, a good approximate description is obtained from a finite number of low-degree moments of the equivalent force or the stress glut. ‘The’ seismic moment tensor is the zeroth degree moment tensor of the stress glut or any moment tensor density and also the first degree moment tensor of the equivalent force. The n′th degree moments of any moment tensor density are uniquely determined by the motion if n = 0, 1 but not if n≥ 2. In the Earth, the stress drop is not a moment tensor density, and its volume integral is not ‘the’ seismic moment tensor. In a later paper these conclusions are shown to be unaffected by relaxing the assumption of a continuous displacement field.},

The most recent of these sequences will be complete with the future occurrence of one or more Mw ≥ 7.0 earthquakes near the city. From a summation of the seismic moment released by historical earthquakes between 500 and 2000 CE we calculate a mean slip deficit rate of 9.9 mm/year. Our moment summation procedure sums the seismic moment associated with known historical earthquakes in the past 1500 years based on rupture length and assumed seismogenic depth. We observed that in the 1999 Izmit earthquake, strongly coupled fault patches were associated with the highest co-seismic slip. In our calculated map of present-day slip-potential, we recognize several such patches from their low present-day rate of microseismicity, e.g. segments beneath the Kumburgaz and Eastern (Çınarcık) Marmara Basins. In contrast, intervening weakly coupled patches host high present-day background seismicity, e.g. the segment beneath the Western (Tekirdağ) Basin. This lends credibility to an interpretation of future earthquakes occurring in three seismogenic segments of the NAFZ corresponding to three deep basins in the Sea of Marmara. The present-day slip deficits reach up to 1.7 m beneath the Western (Tekirdağ Basin) segment, and 4.0 m and 5.4 m beneath the Central (Central High and Kumburgaz Basin) and Eastern (Çınarcık Basin) segments, respectively. These segments most recently ruptured in August 1766, May 1766 and October 1509 and currently have a potential to generate Mw 7.2, Mw 7.4 and Mw 7.5, earthquakes respectively. Although contiguous ruptures have not occurred historically, ruptures of contiguous segments could occur as a Mw 7.5 earthquake in the west, or a Mw 7.6 earthquake in the east or as a single through-going Mw 7.7 rupture.},

	abstract = {Constraining the maximum likely magnitude of future earthquakes on continental transform faults has fundamental consequences for the expected seismic hazard. Since the recurrence time for those earthquakes is typically longer than a century, such estimates rely primarily on well-documented historical earthquake catalogs, when available. Here we discuss the maximum observed earthquake magnitudes along different sections of the North Anatolian Fault Zone (NAFZ) in relation to the age of the fault activity, cumulative offset, slip rate and maximum length of coherent fault segments. The findings are based on a newly compiled catalog of historical earthquakes in the region, using the extensive literary sources that exist owing to the long civilization record. We find that the largest M7.8–8.0 earthquakes are exclusively observed along the older eastern part of the NAFZ that also has longer coherent fault segments. In contrast, the maximum observed events on the younger western part where the fault branches into two or more strands are smaller. No first-order relations between maximum magnitudes and fault offset or slip rates are found. The results suggest that the maximum expected earthquake magnitude in the densely populated Marmara–Istanbul region would probably not exceed M7.5. The findings are consistent with available knowledge for the San Andreas Fault and Dead Sea Transform, and can help in estimating hazard potential associated with different sections of large transform faults.},
